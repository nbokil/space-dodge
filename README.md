# Space Dodge
The following project is for the course 05-499: Crowd Programming at CMU. Players can move a spaceship left and right to dodge incoming obstacles. For every second they play, they receive a $0.01 bonus, up to a max of $2.00. The game is designed to work on Mechanical Turk, and will be used to determine whether using the crowd could lead to better playing results (eg. a higher score).
